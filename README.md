# DEVolunteer

Connecting Developers and Non-Profits for the Greater Good

### The Big Idea

**As a developer**, you can reach out to non-profit organizations (NPO's) that are looking for the perfect dev to build their app or website. If you've already collaborated with a specific NPO, you have the option to review your overall experience.

**As a non-profit organization**, you can post the project(s) you need tackled, and reach out to developers who are interested in working with you. You can also review your experience(s) with specific Developers you've worked with.

### Specs

- Full-stack application with an iOS front-end, and RESTful JS API as a back-end.
- Utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose.js to store User information.
- Utilizes Mocha and Chai for testing.

### Usage

- Fork and clone this repository, and run ```npm install``` in your terminal to install all required dependencies.
- Create a file called '.env' at the root level of the project directory. In the file, specify PORT and MONGODB_URI variables:
   ```
  PORT=3000
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/devolunteer
  ```
- Create a directory called 'db' at the root level of the project directory. This is where Mongo will store all of its necessary files.
- At the root level of the project directory, start the Mongo server by running ```mongod --dbpath ./db```.
- In a second terminal window, run ```npm run start```. Your server should start up on the port specified in your .env file.
